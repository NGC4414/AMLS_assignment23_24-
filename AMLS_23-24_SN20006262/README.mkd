This Github page contains the code for the 2023-2024 AMLS assignment. The assignment requres to classify two medical images datasets, PneumoniaMNIST (binary classification) and PathMNIST(multi-class classification).

The code is organized as follows:

-`AMLS_23-24_SN20006262 folder` : contains all the code.
  - `Folder A` : contains the code to execute task A
  - `Folder B` : contains the code to execute task B
  - `Datasets`: this folder is basically empty (should be filled with PathMNIST.npz and PneumoniaMNIST.npz files), however it contains a readme file to explain how to use the Datasets folder. 
  - `main.py`: file that handles teh execution of the code
  - `README.mkd`: this file.
   

# Folder A: PneumoniaMNIST Binary-classification task
## Description
This folder contains the files for task A. It contains the following files:
- `train_and_test_A.py`: file that contains the functions used to load the data, train and test the models.
- `task.py`: file used to execute the code

## File Structure
- `load_data_pneumonia.py`: Contains the function to load the PneumoniaMNIST dataset.
- `visualization.py`: Includes functions for visualizing images and class distributions in the dataset.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Implements Logistic Regression for the dataset.
- `svm_models.py`: Contains functions to train and evaluate SVM models with different kernels.
- `svm_pca.py`: SVM models integrated with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- `cnn_model.py`: Defines, trains, and saves a CNN model for the dataset.
- `evaluation_metrics.py`: Includes functions to plot ROC curves, confusion matrices, and training history.
- `predict.py`: Functions to make predictions using trained Logistic Regression, SVM, and CNN models.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project, offering a menu to choose different models and tasks.

## Packages Required
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs and images.
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
- `keras`: For building and training neural network models.
- `tensorflow`: Backend for Keras and general ML tasks.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning models like SVM and Logistic Regression, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
- `skimage`: For image processing tasks.

## How to Run
1. Ensure all required packages are installed.
2. Run `main.py` to start the program and follow the on-screen prompts to select different analysis tasks.

# Task B: PathMNIST Multi-classification task

## Description
This project is dedicated to the analysis of the PathMNIST dataset, a collection of histopathological images, using various deep learning techniques. The primary focus is on building and evaluating a simplified version of the VGG network, both with and without data augmentation.

## File Structure
- `load_data_pathmnist.py`: Loads the PathMNIST dataset.
- `visualization.py`: Contains functions for visualizing class distributions and sample images from the dataset.
- `vgg_model.py`: Defines the architecture for a simplified VGG network.
- `training.py`: Includes functions to train the VGG model with and without data augmentation.
- `evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating the trained models and visualizing the results.
- `focal_loss.py`: Implements a custom focal loss function for model training.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project, allowing the user to select different tasks such as training or using pre-trained models.

## Packages Required
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs and images.
- `keras`: For building and training neural network models.
- `tensorflow`: Backend for Keras and general ML tasks.
- `sklearn`: For preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure all the required packages are installed.
2. Run `main.py` to start the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to train new models or use pre-trained models for analyzing the PathMNIST dataset.

## Tasks
- Train a simplified VGG model without data augmentation.
- Train a simplified VGG model with data augmentation.
- Evaluate and visualize the performance of trained models.
- Option to exit the program.

Please note that training models require the `vgg_no_aug.h5` and `vgg_with_aug.h5` files to be present in the `B` directory for using pre-trained models.
